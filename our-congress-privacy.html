					<h2>Our Congress Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>This privacy policy applies to versions of Our Congress available in the iOS App Store as of January 10, 2020.</p>
					<p>At Pterosaur Design, your privacy is important to us.  We believe that the most effective way to protect your privacy is to collect and store only the bare minimum information needed to support the features you expect from our apps.  This document describes the data used by Our Congress.</p>
					<h3>What data does Our Congress store on your device?</h3>
					<p>Our Congress stores information on your device to preserver the state of the app after it is removed from system memory (for example, when your device is shut down).  This information includes your congressional district, any address information you may have entered, and lists of representatives and bills you have flagged. If you back up your device using iCloud or iTunes, this information will be included in your backup files.</p>
					<p>In addition, some information about items you have viewed in the app, such as member photos, may be stored on your device in a temporary cache to improve app performance. This information will not be retained in iCloud or iTunes backups.</p>
					<h3>What information does Our Congress transmit over the internet?</h3>
					<p>In order to provide you with information on the members and activities of congress, Our Congress retrieves information over the internet from a variety of public and private organizations.  It may be possible for these entities to track certain information about you our your device based on your data requests, just as they would if you accessed a web page. A complete list of data sources is included under the menu item "About Our Congress" in the Our Congress app.</p>
					<p>If you choose to provide feedback to Pterosaur Design via the app's "E-mail Pterosaur Design" button, you will have the opportunity to send an e-mail to Pterosaur Design which will be transmitted over the internet using standard secure protocols.</p>
					<p>Finally, depending on your iOS system settings, Apple may collect some information on the usage of all apps on your device including Our Congress.  Please see Apple's privacy policy for information pertaining to Apple's collection and management of such data.</p>
					<h3>What information does Pterosaur Design store about you?</h3>
					<p>If you send us an e-mail, we will have your e-mail address and any other metadata associated with your message. Pterosaur Design may use this information to reply to your message, as appropriate.</p>
					<p>We will not use your e-mail address or other e-mail metadata for marketing purposes.</p>
					<p>We will not sell your e-mail address or other e-mail metadata to any third party.</p>
					<h3>Questions?</h3>
					<p>If you have any questions about how we treat your data, please contact Pterosaur Design at <a href="mailto:pterosaurdesign@gmail.com">pterosaurdesign@gmail.com</a>.</p>
