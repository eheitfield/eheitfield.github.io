	    		<p>Doppler Ball is a new retro-style, action arcade game available exclusively on the iOS platform. A modern interpretation of classic paddle-style games from the 1970s and 80s, Doppler Ball challenges the player to use a humming, hyperactive ball to knock down blocks and clear levels. Along the way, the player must activate a variety of power-ups while avoiding tricky penalty blocks. Play takes place within a series of three-dimensional tubes of various shapes containing blocks arranged in increasingly complex patterns.</p>
	    		<p>Doppler Ball gets its name from the “Doppler effect” – the name given to the fact that the frequency of light or sound emitted from an object depends on its relative velocity (think about train whistles). Using a sophisticated physics engine and spatial audio processing, the game simulates this effect by adjusting the color and pitch of the ball as it moves towards or away from the player.</p>
	    		<p>Doppler ball is distributed using a shareware model. It is free to download from the iOS App Store. The “Classic” game, which includes four levels and one type of power-up, is fully playable and should provide players with hours of entertainment. For players interested in an additional challenge, the “Excel” game can be unlocked with a one-time, in-app purchase. The Excel game includes eighteen unique and highly replayable levels and a variety of fun power-up and penalty blocks.</p>
	    		<p>Doppler Ball for iOS features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Immersive, 3-D audio effects sound great with headphone</li>
					<li>Universal app looks great, plays great, on all sizes of iPhones and iPads</li>
					<li>Supports Apple Game Center leaderboards, challenges and achievements</li>
					<li>Compelling EDM soundtrack</li>
					<li>No adds, ever</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Doppler Ball requires iOS 9.0 or above and is optimized to run on the iPhone 5 and above and all recent-model iPads.</p>
				<p>Coming soon: Doppler Ball for Apple TV promises to turn the living room into a virtual racquetball court. Employing the same great physics engine and game mechanics as the iOS game, Doppler Ball for Apple TV will feature head-to-head multiplayer gameplay using the Siri remote’s motion-tracking capabilities.</p>
