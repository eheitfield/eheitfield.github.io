		        	Your congressional representatives were elected to serve you, so make your voice heard!  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1299483227">Our Congress</a> provides a simple way to follow the work of the United States House and Senate.  Contact your elected representatives on the web, by phone, or through social media.  Our Congress brings together data from government entities and nonprofit organizations to put a wealth of information about congress at your fingertips.
		        </p>
				<p>
					With just a few taps voters can use Our Congress to
					<ul>
						<li>contact a member of Congress by phone, the web, or social media</li>
						<li>read a member's press releases and sponsored legislation,</li>
						<li>track bills as they work their way though the House and Senate,</li>
						<li>follow the work of congressional committees as they gather information on the issues of the day,</li>
						<li>review recent votes, nominations, and floor actions, and</li>

				</p>
				<p>
					Pterosaur Design has even included a copy of the U.S. Constitution for easy reference.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Congress was designed with accessibility in mind. Using new APIs introduced in iOS 11, Our Congress supports dynamic type on all screens so that the app is fully functional at even the largest font sizes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Congress relies on data from a number of sources. ProPublica's Congress API provides up-to-date information on members of congress and active legislation. This information is supplemented with additional data from The @unitedstates Project and the Library of Congress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Congress is completely free and includes no ads or tracking of any kind. It requires iOS 11 and supports both iPhones and iPads.
