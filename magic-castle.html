						<p>Learn the magic of let ters with Magic Castle ABC. Enter a magical world and learn to become a letter wizard!</p>
						<p>Magic Castle ABC is a fun and engaging educational game designed to help preschoolers learn the shapes and sounds of their letters. Your child creates a character and leads him or her through a series of progressively harder challenges matching letters with words. Along the way, in-game rewards motivate your child to keep practicing.</p>
						<p>We hope your child enjoys Magic Castle ABC. Making it was a family effort. Dad did the programming and the kids helped with the design, artwork and voices.</p>
