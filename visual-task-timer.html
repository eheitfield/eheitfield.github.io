	    		<p>Visual Task Timer is countdown timer for public speakers, teachers, students and their parents. Everything about Visual Task Timer is designed to make it easy to see at a glance exactly how much time is left so you can concentrate on finishing your task. No more trying to find a wall clock halfway through a final exam or glancing at your watch in the middle of a big presentation.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Visual Task Timer's elegant, high-contrast display is easy to read from a distance.</li>
					<li>Set an audible low-time warning to remind you to start wrapping up.</li>
					<li>Visual Task Timer lets you disable your device’s lock screen so the time display remains easily visible throughout your task.</li>
					<li>An optional overtime clock display can tell you how much extra time you’ve used.</li>
					<li>Customize Visual Task Timer to suit your needs with settings to mute sounds and use light or dark color themes.</li>
					<li>Visual Task Timer is a universal App.  It works great on all sizes of iPhones and iPads and supports iPad split-screen multitasking.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Visual Task Timer supports iOS automation and inter-app communication using Siri Shortcuts and URL schemes. You can ask Siri to start a new timer or report the current time, and power users can to launch, configure, and query Visual Task Timer from other Apps such as Shortucts, Safari, Launch Center Pro and Scriptable. Documentation on using URL schemes to work with Visual Task Timer is available <a href="./visual-task-timer-automation.html">here</a></p>
				<p>Why does the world need another countdown timer app? App creater Erik Heitfield Explains:</p>
				<blockquote>I’m frequently required to give public speeches or make presentations. I'm also quite nearsighted, which makes it difficult for me to read wall clocks from a distance. I’ve long sought a simple timer app that I could just set down on a nearby desk or podium to help keep my talks from running too long. No app I could find quite fit the bill. Some are beautiful but difficult to read. Many let my phone’s lock screen blank the display after a few minutes. And as far as I can tell, none provide an option for an audible low-time reminder. I designed Visual Task Timer to meet my own needs, but I’ve since found that it can serve many other useful functions.</blockquote>
				<p>Kids can use Visual Task Timer help them keep track of how much time they need to spend doing homework or practicing their musical instruments. Teachers can use it to help administer tests. Just prop an iPad up in front of the class, and your students will know exactly how much time remains before “pencils down.” Need to keep a panel of conference presenters on schedule? No need to assign an intern to keep time; Visual Task Timer can do the job.</p>
				<p>Visual Task Timer is free to use and includes no tracking of any kind. Users may choose to voluntarily support continued development of this app througn an in-app purchase. Our privacy policy can be found <a href="./visual-task-timer-privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
