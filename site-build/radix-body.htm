					<p>Some people ask, "who would want a clack that tells the time in binary?" I ask, "who WOULDN'T want such a clock?" Anyone can tell the time in base ten, but how many people know the time in base sixteen?
					<p>Key features of Radix Clock include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>show the time in binary, octal, decimal, or hexidecimal</li>
						<li>digital or analog display</li>
						<li>12 or 24 hour clock</li>
						<li>Keep Awake mode so you can use your device as a desk clock</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Radix Clock requires iOS 13 and is designed to look great on any size iOS device.</p>
					<p>Radix Clock includes no ads or web tracking of any kind. Our privacy policy can be found <a href="./radix-privacy.html">here</a>.
