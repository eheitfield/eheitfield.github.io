					<p>Pixel Grid Artist is a simple but powerful pixel art editor. Use it to create retro-style bitmap images, patterns for needlework, or any kind of artwork that involves arranging grids of colored squares.</p>
					<p>To begin you can either start drawing on a bank canvas or create a pixel art project from an image in your photo library. If you start from an image, you can use Pixel Grid Artist's "posterizing" feature to use only a small number of colors. This can produce striking effects and is a great choice if you're designing a pattern for needlework.</p>
					<p>Edit your artwork by tapping on individual pixels, tracing lines and curves, or using a number built-in shape stencils. Color management tools allow you to easily fill a region with color or replace an existing color.</p>
					<p>When you're ready to share your artwork you can export it as a jpg, png, or pdf file and text or email it to a friend.</p>
					<p>Pixel Grid Artist was developed by a dad at the request of his daughter, who needed an easy way to create patterns for friendship bracelets and needlework projects on the go. It has been extensively tested by a design-minded teenager. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it!</p>
