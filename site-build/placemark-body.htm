					<p>There are many apps that help you get around, but none are as convenient as Placemark+. Simply push the big “Place Mark” button to save your location, then go about your business. When you’re ready to return, Placemark+ will point you in the right direction, and a map from your current location to your marked destination is just one tap away. Placemark+ also keeps track of the places you’ve visited and lets you save a list of your favorite locations. Tap on one of your favorites and Placemark+ will take you there. You can even send a stored location to your favorite turn-by-turn navigation app, or share it with a friend via text or e-mail.</p>
					<p>Placemark+’s minimalist design emphasizes simple, frictionless efficiency. It shows you just the information you need to get where you’re going without any extra clutter or distractions.</p>
