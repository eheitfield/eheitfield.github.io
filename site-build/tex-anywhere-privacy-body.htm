					<h2>TeX Anywhere Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>This privacy policy applies to all versions of TeX Anywhere available as of August 10, 2019.</p>
					<p>At Pterosaur Design, your privacy is important to us.  We believe that the most effective way to protect your privacy is to collect and store only the bare minimum information needed to support the features you expect from our apps.  This document describes the data used by TeX Anywhere.</p>
					<h3>What data does TeX Anywhere store on your device?</h3>
					<p>TeX Anywhere stores a very small amount of non-personally identifying information on your devices in order to preserve the state of the app when it is removed from system memory. This information includes user settings such as the desired color theme and data files for the equations you've created. If you back up your device, this information will be included in your backup files.</p>
					<h3>What information does TeX Anywhere transmit over the internet?</h3>
					<p>With the following exceptions, TeX Anywhere does not transmit user information over the Internet.</p>
					<p>If you choose to provide feedback to Pterosaur Design via the app's "Send Feedback" button, you will have the opportunity to send an e-mail to Pterosaur Design which will be transmitted using standard secure protocols.</p>
					<p>If you choose to support development of TeX Anywhere by making an in-app purchase (IAP), TeX Anywhere will communicate with Apple's servers to process this transaction. Please see Apple's privacy policy for information pertaining to Apple's management of this data.</p>
					<p>If you use TeX Anywhere's Messages extension to text an equation, data for this equation will be tranmitted via Apple's servers or SMS.</p>
					<p>Finally, depending on your iOS system settings, Apple may collect some information on the usage of all apps on your device including TeX Anywhere.  Please see Apple's privacy policy for information pertaining to Apple's collection and management of such data.</p>
