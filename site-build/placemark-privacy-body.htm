					<h2>Placemark+ Policy</h2>
					<p>This privacy policy applies to versions of Placemark+ available in the iOS App Store as of February 10, 2020.</p>
					<p>At Pterosaur Design, your privacy is important to us. We believe that the most effective way to protect your privacy is to collect and store only the bare minimum information needed to support the features you expect from our apps. This document describes the data used by Placemark+.</p>
					<h3>What data does Placemark+ store on your device?</h3>
					<p>Placemark+ stores information such as coordinates and address information on the places you log your device. If you back up your device, this information will be included in your backup files.</p>
					<h3>What information does TeX Anywhere transmit over the internet?</h3>
					<p>When you log a location, Placemark+ sends coordinate information to Apple's servers to retrieve address data. Placemark+ also communicates with Apple's servers to download map data. If you choose to share a saved location with another app, such as Messages, that app may transmit information about your saved location.</p>
					<p>If you choose to provide feedback to Pterosaur Design via the app's "E-Mail Pterosaur Design" button, you will have the opportunity to send an e-mail to Pterosaur Design which will be transmitted using standard secure protocols.</p>
					<p>If you choose to support development of Placemark+ by making an in-app purchase (IAP), Placemark+ will communicate with Apple's servers to process this transaction. Please see Apple's privacy policy for information pertaining to Apple's management of this data.</p>
					<p>Finally, depending on your iOS system settings, Apple may collect some information on the usage of all apps on your device including Placemark+. Please see Apple's privacy policy for information pertaining to Apple's collection and management of such data.</p>

					<p>If you send us an e-mail, we will have your e-mail address and any other metadata associated with your message.  Pterosaur Design may use this information to reply to your message, as appropriate.</p>
					<p>We will not use your e-mail address or other e-mail metadata for marketing purposes.</p>
