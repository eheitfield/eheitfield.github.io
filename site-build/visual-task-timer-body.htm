				<p>Why does the world need another countdown timer app? I’m frequently required to give public speeches or make presentations.  I'm also quite nearsighted, which makes it difficult for me to read wall clocks from a distance.  I’ve long sought a simple timer app that I could just set down on a nearby desk or podium to help keep my talks from running too long. No app I could find quite fit the bill. Some are beautiful but difficult to read. Many let my phone’s lock screen blank the display after a few minutes. And as far as I can tell, none provide an option for an audible low-time reminder. I designed Visual Task Timer to meet my own needs, but I’ve since found that it can serve many other useful functions. We use It with our kids to help them keep track of how much time they need to spend doing homework or practicing their musical instruments. Teachers can use it to help administer tests. Just prop an iPad up in front of the class, and your students will know exactly how much time remains before “pencils down.” Need to keep a panel of conference presenters on schedule? No need to assign an intern to keep time; let Visual Task Timer do the job. We hope you’ll agree that Visual Task Timer lives up to Pterosaur Design’s motto: “do simple things well.”</p>
				<p>Visual Task Timer is free to use and includes no tracking of any kind. Users may choose to voluntarily support continued development of this app througn an in-app purchase. Our privacy policy can be found <a href="./our-congress-privacy.html">here</a>.</p>
